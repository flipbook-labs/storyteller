# Story Format

# Storybook

Any ModuleScript with a `.storybook` extension will be picked up as a Storybook.

Storybooks that do not have a `storyRoots` array will not be shown in the Flipbook UI.

</aside>

The properties that can be used in the module are as follows:

| **Property**                   | **Description**                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `storyRoots: { Instance }`     | Locations that the Storybook manages. Each instance will have its descendants searched for Story modules.                             |
| `name: string?`                | An optional name for the Storybook. Defaults to the module name with the extension removed. i.e. `Sample.storybook` becomes `Sample`. |
| `packages: { [string]: any }?` | An optional dictionary used for supplying the Storybook with the packages to use when rendering its Stories.                          |

This dictionary can also be supplied per-Story to change the renderer used, but it can be convenient to define your packages globally to avoid repetition. |

Example Storybook module:

```lua
-- Sample.storybook
return {
	storyRoots = {
		script.Parent.Components
	},
}
```

## Legacy support

Flipbook v1 used a different approach for defining packages. For convenience, v2 provides backwards compatibility for the following Storybook properties:

A future version of Flipbook may remove this compatibility layer. It is recommended to migrate to `packages`.

</aside>

| **Property**     | **Description**                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| roact: any       | Locations that the Storybook manages. Each instance will have its descendants searched for Story modules.                             |
| react: any       | An optional name for the Storybook. Defaults to the module name with the extension removed. i.e. `Sample.storybook` becomes `Sample`. |
| reactRoblox: any | The version of ReactRoblox to use when mounting React components. Mutually exclusive with `react`.                                    |

Under the hood these simply map to `packages.Roact`, `packages.React`, and `packages.ReactRoblox`.

# Story

Any ModuleScript with a `.story` extension will be picked up as a Story when it is a descendant of one of the `storyRoots` that a Storybook manages.

The only required member of a Story definition is the `story` property.

| **Property**                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `story: <T>((props: StoryProps) -> T)` | T`                                                                                                                                                                                                       |  |
| `name: string?`                        | The name of the Story as it appears in Flipbook. Defaults to the name of the Story module. i.e. `Sample.story` becomes `Sample`                                                                          |
| `summary: string?`                     | A description of the Story that will appear above the rendered preview in Flipbook.                                                                                                                      |
| `controls: { [string]: any }?`         | Controls allow for on-the-fly configuration of your rendered UI. Read more about how to define and use Controls here: [Controls](https://www.notion.so/Controls-12f95b7912f8804388e1d746a6617716?pvs=21) |

The type of the `story` property is dependent on what kind of Story is being rendered. Flipbook does not prescribe one particular way of writing Stories, or even a particular UI library that must be used.
Stories can be written for React, Fusion, legacy Roact, plain Roblox Instances, and anything you can think of with [Manual Stories](https://www.notion.so/Story-format-12f95b7912f880068da6d74c472bf186?pvs=21).

Example Story module:

```lua
return {
	story = function(props)

	end
}
```
